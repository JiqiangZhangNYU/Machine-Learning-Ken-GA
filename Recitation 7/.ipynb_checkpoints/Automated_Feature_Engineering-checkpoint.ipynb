    "# Introduction: Automated Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at an exciting development in data science: automated feature engineering. A machine learning model can only learn from the data we give it, and making sure that data is relevant to the task is one of the most crucial steps in the machine learning pipeline (this is made clear in the excellent paper [\"A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning\"](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, manual feature engineering is a tedious task and is limited by both human imagination - there are only so many features we can think to create - and by time - creating new features is time-intensive. Ideally, there would be an objective method to create an array of diverse new candidate features that we can then use for a machine learning task. This process is meant to not replace the data scientist, but to make her job easier and allowing her to supplement domain knowledge with an automated workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through an implementation of using [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/), an open-source Python library for automatically creating features with relational data (where the data is in structured tables). Although there are now many efforts working to enable automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning, there has been a lack of automating work on the feature engineering aspect of the pipeline. This library seeks to close that gap and the general methodology has been proven effective in both [machine learning competitions with the data science machine](https://github.com/HDI-Project/Data-Science-Machine) and [business use cases](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/predicting-credit-card-fraud/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the basic idea of featuretools we will use an example dataset consisting of three tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `clients`: information about clients at a credit union\n",
    "* `loans`: previous loans taken out by the clients\n",
    "* `payments`: payments made/missed on the previous loans\n",
    "\n",
    "The general problem of feature engineering is taking disparate data, often distributed across multiple tables, and combining it into a single table that can be used for training a machine learning model. Featuretools has the ability to do this for us, creating many new candidate features with minimal effort. These features are combined into a single table that can then be passed on to our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load in the data and look at the problem we are working with."

Later, we see these are known in featuretools as transformation feature primitives because they act on column in a single table. "

You can read the [original paper here](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf), and although it's quite readable, it's not necessary to understand the details to do automated feature engineering. The concept of Deep Feature Synthesis is to use basic building blocks known as feature primitives (like the transformations and aggregations done above) that can be stacked on top of each other to form new features. The depth of a \"deep feature\" is equal to the number of stacked primitives. \n",

    "An entity is simply a table, which is represented in Pandas as a `dataframe`. Each entity must have a uniquely identifying column, known as an index. For the clients dataframe, this is the `client_id` because each id only appears once in the `clients` data. In the `loans` dataframe, `client_id` is not an index because each id might appear more than once. The index for this dataframe is instead `loan_id`. \n",
    "\n",

If the data does not have a unique index we can tell featuretools to make an index for the entity by passing in `make_index = True` and specifying a name for the index. If the data also has a uniquely identifying time index, we can pass that in as the `time_index` parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools will automatically infer the variable types (numeric, categorical, datetime) of the columns in our data, but we can also pass in specific datatypes to override this behavior. As an example, even though the `repaid` column in the `loans` dataframe is represented as an integer, we can tell featuretools that this is a categorical feature since it can only take on two discrete values. This is done using an integer with the variables as keys and the feature types as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we create the three entities and add them to the `EntitySet`.  The syntax is relatively straightforward with a few notes: for the `payments` dataframe we need to make an index, for the `loans` dataframe, we specify that `repaid` is a categorical variable, and for the `payments` dataframe, we specify that `missed` is a categorical feature.

    "## Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the entities (tables) in an `EntitySet`, we now need to tell featuretools [how they are related with a relationship](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html#adding-a-relationship). The most intuitive way to think of relationships is with the parent to child analogy: a parent-to-child relationship is one-to-many because for each parent, there can be multiple children. The `client` dataframe is therefore the parent of the `loans` dataframe because while there is only one row for each client in the `client` dataframe, each client may have several previous loans covering multiple rows in the `loans` dataframe. Likewise, the `loans` dataframe is the parent of the `payments` dataframe because each loan will have multiple payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships are what allow us to group together datapoints using aggregation primitives and then create new features. As an example, we can group all of the previous loans associated with one client and find the average loan amount. We will discuss the features themselves more in a little bit, but for now let's define the relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define relationships, we need to specify the parent variable and the child variable. This is the variable that links two entities together. In our example, the `client` and `loans` dataframes are linked together by the `client_id` column. Again, this is a parent to child relationship because for each `client_id` in the parent `client` dataframe, there may be multiple entries of the same `client_id` in the child `loans` dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "We codify relationships in the language of featuretools by specifying the parent variable and then the child variable. After creating a relationship, we add it to the `EntitySet`. "

    "## Deep Feature Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "While feature primitives are useful by themselves, the main benefit of using featuretools arises when we stack primitives to get deep features. The depth of a feature is simply the number of primitives required to make a feature. So, a feature that relies on a single aggregation would be a deep feature with a depth of 1, a feature that stacks two primitives would have a depth of 2 and so on. The idea itself is lot simpler than the name \"deep feature synthesis\" implies. (I think the authors were trying to ride the way of deep neural network hype when they named the method!) To read more about deep feature synthesis, check out [the documentation](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/afe.html) or the [original paper by Max Kanter et al](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Already in the dataframe we made by specifying the primitives manually we can see the idea of feature depth. For instance, the MEAN(loans.loan_amount) feature has a depth of 1 because it is made by applying a single aggregation primitive. This feature represents the average size of a client's previous loans."

    "Deep feature synthesis has created 90 new features out of the existing data! While we could have created all of these manually, I am glad to not have to write all that code by hand. The primary benefit of featuretools is that it creates features without any subjective human biases. Even a human with considerable domain knowledge will be limited by their imagination when making new features (not to mention time). Automated feature engineering is not limited by these factors (instead it's limited by computation time) and provides a good starting point for feature creation. This process likely will not remove the human contribution to feature engineering completely because a human can still use domain knowledge and machine learning expertise to select the most important features or build new features from those suggested by automated deep feature synthesis.\n",

    "While automatic feature engineering solves one problem, it provides us with another problem: too many features! Although it's difficult to say which features will be important to a given machine learning task ahead of time, it's likely that not all of the features made by featuretools add value. In fact, having too many features is a significant issue in machine learning because it makes training a model much harder. The [irrelevant features can drown out the important features](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a83b/ddb34618cc68f1014ca12eef7f537825d104.pdf), leaving a model unable to learn how to map the features to the target.\n",

    "This problem is known as the [\"curse of dimensionality\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality#Machine_learning) and is addressed through the process of [feature reduction and selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html), which means [removing low-value features](https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-machine-learning-python/) from the data. Defining which features are useful is an important problem where a data scientist can still add considerable value to the feature engineering task. Feature reduction will have to be another topic for another day!"

    "In this notebook, we saw how to apply automated feature engineering to an example dataset. This is a powerful method which allows us to overcome the human limits of time and imagination to create many new features from multiple tables of data. Featuretools is built on the idea of deep feature synthesis, which means stacking multiple simple feature primitives - __aggregations and transformations__ - to create new features. Feature engineering allows us to combine information across many tables into a single dataframe that we can then use for machine learning model training. Finally, the next step after creating all of these features is figuring out which ones are important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Featuretools is currently the only Python option for this process, but with the recent emphasis on automating aspects of the machine learning pipeline, other competitiors will probably enter the sphere. While the exact tools will change, the idea of automatically creating new features out of existing data will grow in importance. Staying up-to-date on methods such as automated feature engineering is crucial in the rapidly changing field of data science. Now go out there and find a problem on which to apply featuretools! \n",
